-mfast-math does not play well with -O1-3
-Os does not play well with sse code.

The reason for the note on 19-08-2005 is that mangled name of functions
depends on some attribute such as  __declspec(dllexport) and __cdecl.
This is the reason why we can't use AC_CHECK_LIB for functions declared
as dllexport. Linking fails in the above case.

When compiling a program with the function "xyz" on cygwin
        - if we use the -mno-cygwin flag it is refrenced as __img__xyz@Q.
        - else we reference it as _xyz
  this works i think when things are declared as __declspec(dllimport)

used the following in ltmain.sh to get things to run under mingw
#if defined (S_IXOTH)
      ((st.st_mode & S_IXOTH) == S_IXOTH) ||
#endif
#if defined (S_IXGRP)
       ((st.st_mode & S_IXGRP) == S_IXGRP) ||
#endif
       ((st.st_mode & S_IXUSR) == S_IXUSR)))

===========

When graphics library (gd) was installed with cygwin a dll cyggd-2.dll was
installed in /usr/bin. The gnu linker (ld) that comes with cygwin is supposed
to expect an argument --dll-search-prefix that defaults to `cyg' for cygwin
installations.

My gcc installation on cygwin is currently broken (at least the -mno-cygwin flag
is), and the linker can not find the above dll. Worked around it by makeing a
symbolic link `libgd.dll' in /usr/lib.
